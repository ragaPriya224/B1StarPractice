SPRING
TOPICS TO BE COVERED:
What is Spring Framework
Where is it used
What is the basic structures of Spring
Setting up a Spring Project


JAR
WAR\


h2db 
JAR -> JAva Archive file 
     - zip file containing java class files 
     
WAR - Web Archive Files 

java -> oracle, open source
  profit? 
     that company - 1 solution 
     others       -> 20+ solutions 
   That's why community driven . 
    parallely developers will also work and gve many class/ packages i.e., framework 
    collection framework 
    
  community drive f/w -> powerful, on trend 
  company driven f/w > outdated. 
  youtube -> may be 
  film -> 1 and half -> outdated.
  
  community drive f/w
     struts 
     hibernate
     spring 
   The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.
   
   Java-based enterprise applications -> API, website, etc
    deployment platform. -> linux, unix, mac, windows

Languages: Kotlin, Groovy, dynamic languages.


Spring mvc, spring boot f/w

Spring f/w integrates with other f/w 
light weight f/w 
TDD? -> Test driven framework


configuration model -> 
configuration tough job 



biscuit - paper - shop -- supermarket
JAR     - POM.xml  internet -> maven 
project object model 

SPRING FEATUREs:

1. POJO 
plain old java object

class -> private variables - public getter/ setter 

2.IOC ->  DI
3. Rest api support
4. follow mvc pattern
5. secure application 
6. batch 
7.  AOP. - loggin, caching, authentication, transaction management etc. 
8. SPRING TEST FRAMEWORKS 
 


create scalable, secure 

spring framework base for springboot, spring cloud   


DI:

which object we're depending, that object we wohn't be creating. 
If we create it by ourselves, it is tight coupling. so we should avoid tight coupling. 

In order to avoid coupling, 

REST API SUPPORT 

DB? database - to store / retrieve data /manipulate data
JDBC ->  JPA, hibernate 

DATA ACCESS FRAMEWORK 

4. follow mvc pattern - MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER

------------------------------------------

orm- OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING


CORE CONTAINER
     core -> core of f/w such as di, ioc
     beans -> provides bean factory 
     context -> appcontext is core part of context module
     EL ->     to query and manipulate 
DATA ACCESS/ INTEGRATION
   handle data access and transactions
   jdbc -> PROVIDES A  abstraction layer 
   ORM -> object relational mapping eg: jpa, hibernate
   OXM -> object/xml mapping
   JMS -> java messaging service .
   
WEB:
   portlet -> provides mvc implementation
   web -> spring web -> provides web oriented features
   servlet -> spring webmvc -> contains mvc, rest implementations
   
 AOP -> aspect orientated programming 
 instrumentation -> class loader implementations
 test -> test module thatsupport junit / integration testing

   diff ways of creating spring project
   
   1. spring initializr
   2. create from ide 
   3. cli 
   
     ------------------------------
Project -> Maven Project

Language -> Maven Project
SpringBoot -> 2.7.3
Project Metadata
 Group  -> package name  - India.Hdfc
 Artifact -> project name  - sales 
Packaging -> WAR
Java    -> 17
Dependencies: whatever dependencies you need, as of now use spring web 

--------------------------------------
After this -> GenerateProject -> download in local
Go to IDE -> right click -> import -> Maven -> Existing maven projects -> Browse the location -> Finish 

--------------------------
M   J ->   Maven  Java Project
