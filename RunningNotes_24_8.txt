WAR - Web Archive Files 

java -> oracle, open source
  profit? 
     that company - 1 solution 
     others       -> 20+ solutions

Spring mvc, spring boot f/w

Spring f/w integrates with other f/w 
light weight f/w 
TDD? -> Test driven framework


configuration model -> 
configuration tough job 



biscuit - shop -- supermarket
JAR     - internet -> maven 


SPRING FEATUREs:

1. POJO 
plain old java object

class -> private variables - public getter/ setter 

2.IOC ->  DI
3. Rest api support
4. follow mvc pattern
5. secure application 
6. batch 
7.  AOP. - loggin, caching, authentication, transaction management etc. 
8. SPRING TEST FRAMEWORKS 
 


create scalable, secure 

spring framework base for springboot, spring cloud   


DI:

which object we're depending, that object we wohn't be creating. 
If we create it by ourselves, it is tight coupling. so we should avoid tight coupling. 

In order to avoid coupling, 

REST API SUPPORT 

DB? database - to store / retrieve data /manipulate data
JDBC ->  JPA, hibernate 

DATA ACCESS FRAMEWORK
