WHAT IS DEVOPS NOT?
------------------
not a tool 
not a tech 

DEVOPS:
development + practices

developer: java/python 
server management: 


developer: full stack/backend/fronte nd 
devops? PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE  + SCRIPTING  or atleast a beginner level

GIT: repository - version control system   -> time machine

Run it tool?
JENKINS CI -> continuous integration 
EG: linux -> open source, world wide, many people will be changing the code simultaneously 
now, we're having code in git.. but to run our code, we need software requirement like jdk 11, python 3.6.3, or etc
which we have to mention
so if we mention -> it will done in a diff server.. and that machine will be of linux/ unix 

that's why we have to learn some UNIX/LINUX COMMANDS 

continuous integration  TOOLS:
Mail transfer protocols, pass/ fail ,variable issue, case issues,
delivery is based on the result on the jenkins 
jenkins-> failed..  ,product cannot be released. 



MINIMUM NEEDED:

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: JAVA/ PYTHON ETC
LINUX/ UNIX COMMANDS BASIC COMMMANDS 
GIT
JENKINS
