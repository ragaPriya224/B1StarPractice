DevOps is a set of software development practices that combine software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

DEVOPS -> PHILOSOPHIES, PRACTICES, TOOLS 
TAKES COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY


WHAT IS DEVOPS NOT?
------------------
not a tool 
not a tech 

DEVOPS:
development + practices

developer: java/python 
server management: 


developer: full stack/backend/fronte nd 
devops? PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE  + SCRIPTING  or atleast a beginner level

GIT: repository - version control system   -> time machine

Run it tool?
JENKINS CI -> continuous integration 
EG: linux -> open source, world wide, many people will be changing the code simultaneously 
now, we're having code in git.. but to run our code, we need software requirement like jdk 11, python 3.6.3, or etc
which we have to mention
so if we mention -> it will done in a diff server.. and that machine will be of linux/ unix 

that's why we have to learn some UNIX/LINUX COMMANDS 

continuous integration  TOOLS:
Mail transfer protocols, pass/ fail ,variable issue, case issues,
delivery is based on the result on the jenkins 
jenkins-> failed..  ,product cannot be released. 



MINIMUM NEEDED:

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: JAVA/ PYTHON ETC
LINUX/ UNIX COMMANDS BASIC COMMMANDS 
GIT
JENKINS 


LINUX/ UNIX COMMANDS BASIC COMMMANDS -> 
  read a file
  navigate to a file 
  find a content , print 

IDE's?
eclipse
spyder
vscode 
pycharm ...etc 

maven/ gradle, puppet, ansible  -> configuration management tool

aws: cloud computing, 
bank project-> updating the balance, withdrawing the money -> basic knowledge about sql queries 

TOP PRIORITY:
programming language
linux basic commands
sql basics 

tools:
git
jenkins
aws 

devops -> vast concept, so u don't have to have deep knowledge about all the concepts 

scripting language:
log file: 
windows: powershell, shellscripting ->
simple -> if , for basic  knowledge is enough 
logical -> thinking, practice, knowledge
