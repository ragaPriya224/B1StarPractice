TO BE COVERED:
Python as a language

How is it different from Java and C#?

Where Python programming is used?

The first simple program using Python

WHAT IS PYTHON?
--------------

Python is a interpreted, interactive, general purpose , object-oriented high level programming language.

interpreted -> which means line-by-line execution of code.  

Interactive -> which means, it returns the result of the statement if correct else it returns the error message that helps in debugging 

general purpose -> which means it can be used to build just about anything. 

object-oriented -> which means, it support object-oriented programming feature 
( it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problem )

high level programming language.-> which means, it reads like English and is more easy to understand. 


HISTORY OF PYTHON:
-----------------

Designed by Guido van Rossum,
Released in 1991
used to build softwares, websites etc. 
Latest version -> Python 3.10. 2
Python foundation holds copyright from 2.1 

BEST IDES FOR PYTHON:
---------------------

PySpark,VS code, jupyter, anaconda, etc
Many PC's, Macs  will have python already installed. to check        Python --version 
IF not, download from here     https://www.python.org/



What is the difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages
Statically typed languages
----------------------------
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is;
EG: JAVA, etc

Dynamically Typed Language
--------------------------

A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc.
Eg: python, js 


What python can do?
-------------------
-> used on server to create web apps
-> connect to db's. Can modify/read files
-> handle big data and perform complex maths

WHY PYTHON?
-----------
-> work on diff platforms
-> simple syntax similiar to english
-> few lines 

PYTHON                          VS              JAVA
-------------------------------------------------------
dynamically, interpreted                      statically, compiled as well as interpreted
beginner -friendly                             senior -level
easier to read/code 
semicolon not mandatory                           semicolon mndatory at end of every statement 


PYTHON VS C#
------------
C#
Based on OOP concepts	
Statically typed. The compiler will give errors for wrong typecasting

Dependency injection works like a charm.
More organized and consistent syntax and format

python:
-------
supports multi-paradigm programming (OOP, procedural)
Dynamic type-casting. No need for variable declarations.
No concept of DI as such, however, you can add customized tags to any object at run time

Simple, easy to read and code, doesn’t contain too many symbols or formats.
--------------------------------------

where python used
------------------
-> desktop
-> game development
-> AI
-> DL
-> ML
-> IOT
-> Data analysis 
-> Web development
->Automation
->Software testing 
 -> Everyday tasks


Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
-----------------------------------------
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.


java -> .java
javascript -> .js
python -> .py

1. write a print statement in python
2. check the type of a variable
