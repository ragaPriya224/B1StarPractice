testing importance 
------------------------------------------

Software testing is the process of executing a program with the aim of finding the error. 
To make our software perform well it should be error-free. 
If testing is done successfully it will remove all the errors from the software.

Requirement Analysis
Test planning
Test cases design
environment setup
test execution-> once test cases executed, if any defect detected, tester should raise the defects(bugs/issues). Once raised, developer should start working on the bugs and they have to fix the bugs. Once bugs are fixed, tester have to make sure, tat bugs are fixed properly..

After all the raised bugs are fixed, tester should do regression testing 
test closure

There are seven principles in software testing: 
 
Testing shows the presence of defects
Exhaustive testing is not possible
Early testing
Defect clustering
Pesticide paradox
Testing is context-dependent
Absence of errors fallacy


1.Testing shows the presence of defects
----------------------------------------
The goal of software testing is to make the software fail.
Software testing reduces the presence of defects.
Software testing talks about the presence of defects and doesnâ€™t talk about the absence of defects.
Software testing can ensure that defects are present but it can not prove that software is defect-free.
Even multiple testing can never ensure that software is 100% bug-free. 
Testing can reduce the number of defects but not remove all defects.

2. Exhaustive testing is not possible
----------------------------------------
It is the process of testing the functionality of the software in all possible inputs (valid or invalid) and pre-conditions is known as exhaustive testing. 
Exhaustive testing is impossible means the software can never test at every test case. 
It can test only some test cases and assume that the software is correct and it will produce the correct output in every test case.
If the software will test every test case then it will take more cost, effort, etc., which is impractical.
